# Step 1: Use Node.js for building the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app files
COPY . .

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use NGINX to serve the build
FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# Copy the React build output to the NGINX web directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose NGINX's default port
EXPOSE 80

# Start NGINX
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
